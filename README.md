# Creature 2d

This project was created one week, where I was home. When my daugter was sleeping, I had some available time,
so I wrote a 2d creature simulation engine, as well as a javafx visualizer, and a genetic algo to evolve the best creatures

Note, you need protoc installed to build.
On Ubuntu: apt-get install protobuf

then:
* mvn compile
* mvn exec:java -Prun-generation

other exec:
* mvn exec:java -Pread-generation
